Wegasoo (pronounced: weh gah seu) is a task executor.

Think of actions being made up of tasks. That's how this works. If you think about Wegasoo in blocks, it is the best choice.

It competes with others such as Sake, by being more verbose and transparent with a nice, colorful CLI.

For example, here is a simple action:

<pre><code>
---
example:
  time:
    utc: |
      self << WGS_Message['the current time in UTC is:',z{Time.now.utc.strftime('%b %d, %Y %H:%M.%S')}]
</code></pre>

And the output of @wegasoo example:time:utc@:

<div style="font-family:monospace;background-color:black;color:white;">
<span style="color:lime;">(<strong>1</strong>/<strong>1</strong>)</span> <span style="color:cyan;"><strong>the current time in UTC is:</strong></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan 1, 2009 0:00.00
</div>
